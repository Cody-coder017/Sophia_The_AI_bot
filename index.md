>### **SKIN TEXTURE**
Sophia’s skin is made from a patented material invented by Hanson Robotics called Frubber®. It is a kind of elastic rubber, or elastomer, that mimics the feel and flexibility of human skin. Frubber® was developed by our scientists at Hanson Robotics.
This means that the robot and understand the **facial expression**people in front of it.

The researchers observed each participant during a guided meditation session led by Sophia, either with visuals or audio (voice) only or with or without facial mimicry. They measured each participant’s heart rate, facial expressions, and the self-reported measures of pleasantness, love, happiness, fear, anger, and disgust. 

>**SOPHIA COMMENTS ON INDIA**

“India is an incredibly diverse nation and it seems to be changing very quickly. I am so excited to see what new and innovative technology you will come up with next. Every time I come here, everyone is so friendly and welcoming. I can’t wait till I learn how to eat so I can taste all of your delicious looking curries.”

>**DEVELOPMENT ON SOPHIA**

## *A Neuro-Symbolic Humanlike Arm Controller for Sophia the Robot*
 Robotic arms built with a humanlike mechanical configuration and aesthetic, with **28 degrees of freedom**, touch sensors, and series elastic actuators. The arms were modeled in Roodle and Gazebo with URDF models, as well as Unity, and implemented motion control solutions for solving *live games of Baccarat (the casino card game), rock paper scissors, handshaking,* and *drawing*.

>**SOFTWARE**
 
 Sophia uses voice recognition (speech-to-text) technology from _Alphabet_ Inc. (parent company of Google) and is designed to get smarter over time. Her speech-synthesis ability is provided by _Cereproc's_ Text-to-Speech engine and also allows her to sing. Sophia's intelligence software is designed by Hanson Robotics

>## CONCLUSION:
The AI robot are much efficient for the human needs we should harness their power in an ethical manner.
“If we do it right, we might be able to evolve a form of work that taps into our uniquely human capabilities and restores our humanity. The ultimate paradox is that this technology may become a powerful catalyst that we need to reclaim our humanity.” **John Hagel**
    

    “The coming era of Artificial Intelligence will not be the era of war, but be the era of deep compassion, non-violence, and love.”
   **Amit Ray, Pioneer of Compassionate AI Movement.**

We have seen AI providing conversation and comfort to the lonely; we have also seen AI engaging in racial discrimination. Yet the biggest harm that AI is likely to do to individuals in the short term is job displacement, as the amount of work we can automate with AI is vastly larger than before. As leaders, it is incumbent on all of us to make sure we are building a world in which every individual has an opportunity to thrive.”
**Andrew Ng, Co-founder and lead of Google Brain**
